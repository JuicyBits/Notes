## Useful command line commands
`npm init`  
- Initialize a Node project

`npm i *package name* --s`  
`npm i *package name* --save-dev`  
`npm i *package name* -g`  
`bower init`  

- Use `git grep "<keyword>"` in terminal to search for keywords in all (non-automatically generated) project files

## Node
#### Importing modules
- Imported modules are cached, meaning there is no cost to importing the same module in multiple files

- Node does IIFE wrapping automatically to prevent polluting the global scope

##  Express
`app.use(express.static('public'));`
- Pass the name of the directory that contains the static assets to the express.static middleware function to start serving the files directly.

`app.use((req, res, next) => {})`  

`app.all((req, res, next) => {})`  
- Used for loading middleware functions at a path for all request methods
- Not derived from any HTTP methods  

`res.sendFile()`  
- Serve static files (e.g. an HTML page)

`res.redirect()`

## Bower
```
"overrides": {
    "*dependency name*"{
        "main": [
            "requiredFile.js"
            "requiredFile.css"
        ]
    }
}
```
- override bower dependencies for use with wiredep if dependencies' own bower.json does not display all required files (or if you would prefer a different file)


#### .bowerrc
- The file where Bower looks for its configuration information

## Gulp
> "A Task Manager for your web projects"

#### wiredep
- Searches bower.json for dependencies  
```
<!-- bower:js -->  
<!-- endbower -->
```

#### gulp-inject
- Inject local dependencies
```
<!-- inject:css -->  
<!-- endinject -->
```

#### nodemon
- Restart server upon file changes ('watch' files can be chosen)

## Mongo
- **MongoD** is the server
- **Mongo** to access mongo commands from command line  
- `_id`s are special ID properties created by Mongo, either self-generated by the client or created automatically by Mongo
    - Best practice is to use the `_id` object in relationships
#### Terminal Commands
`show dbs`
- View all databases  

`show collections`
- View all collections in current DB  

`use [db name]`
- Set active DB  

`db.[collection name].find().pretty();`
- View *pretty* form of all data in collection

`sudo killall -15 mongod`
- Kill all instances of mongod (if `^-c` doesn't work)

`export PATH=/Users/JuicyBits/Documents/mongodb/bin:$PATH`
- Export to Mongo Binaries path

## EJS
- To pass HTML markup to EJS, use `<%- ... %>` instead of `<%= ... %>`
- EJS supports partial views with `<%- include('ejs filename') -%>`

## Body-Parser
- Middleware used by Express to parse body requests (often into JSON)

## Other

- Use `Postman` to easily test `HTTP` requests (without having to create dummy forms to test `POST` requests, say)
