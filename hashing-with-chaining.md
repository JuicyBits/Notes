**Pigeonhole principle** - If *n* items are put into *m* containers and *n* > *m*, then at least one container must contain more than one item
  - Causes **collisions**

**Chaining** - If one slot of a hash table encounters multiple colliding values, store those values as a list within that slot

**Simple uniform Hashing** - Each key is equally likely to be hashed to any slot of the table, independent of where other keys hashing`
